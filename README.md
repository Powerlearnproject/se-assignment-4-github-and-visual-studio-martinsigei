Importance of Branches
Isolation: Work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without disrupting the main codebase.
Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on different branches simultaneously.
Version Control: Maintain a clean and organized history of changes.
Process of Creating a Branch, Making Changes, and Merging
Creating a Branch:

Navigate to the repository in GitHub or your terminal.
Use the command git branch <branch-name> to create a new branch.
Switch to the new branch with git checkout <branch-name> or use git checkout -b <branch-name> to create and switch in one step.
Making Changes:

Make changes to the files in your local branch.
Stage the changes with git add <file-name>.
Commit the changes with git commit -m "Description of changes".
Pushing Changes:

Push the branch to the remote repository with git push origin <branch-name>.
Creating a Pull Request:

In GitHub, go to the repository and click "Compare & pull request".
Review the changes and create the pull request for others to review.
Merging Changes:

After the pull request is reviewed and approved, merge it into the main branch (usually main or master).
You can do this through the GitHub interface by clicking "Merge pull request" and then "Confirm merge".
Alternatively, use the command git merge <branch-name> in your terminal while on the main branch.
Deleting the Branch (optional):

Once merged, you can delete the branch to keep the repository clean.
Use the command git branch -d <branch-name> locally.
Delete the branch in GitHub by clicking "Delete branch" after merging.
Branches help maintain a clean and organized workflow, allowing multiple features or fixes to be developed simultaneously and merged only when they are ready.

Pull Requests and Code Reviews:

What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request.

A pull request in GitHub is a method for proposing changes to a codebase. It facilitates code reviews and collaboration by allowing developers to discuss and review the proposed changes before merging them into the main branch.
